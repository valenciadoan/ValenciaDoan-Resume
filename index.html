        </h1>Marketing Manager
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Valencia Doan and I am currently a student at UCR. I am a marketing manager and aspire to become a business owner after I graduate with a Bachelors in Business Administration from UCR, Spring of 2026. I was originally from the Bay Area. I was a very active student in high school and plan to be as well in college. I am apart of AMA, a business organization that stands for American Marketing Association and is also in VSA, Vietnamese Student Association, where I hold an intern position. I am currently looking for an internship in the business field, to get experience and explore my career options in business. <br><br>

        I was incredibly involved in my high school through clubs and organizations, and was constantly interacting with the student body. I listed all my major extracurriculars that I took part in on my resume, but I will provide a quick rundown of what I was in. My four main commitments were ASB (associated student body), Interact (a service club), VSA (Vietnamese student association), and Badminton. I was a part of ASB for all 4 years: 2 years as class treasurer and 2 years as class president. ASB, although the infamous stereotype associated with it, tremendously helped shape who I am today, and pushed me out of my comfort zone at various times. When I first joined, I was always afraid to voice my opinions and speak in front of the class, however I am more comfortable than when I first started. In Interact, I was in the club for all 4 years: Freshman year I was a general member, Sophomore year I was a board member, where I shadowed officers, and in Junior/Senior year I was the Board Director and Co-President. Interact broadened my network and allowed me to create numerous lasting connections and  friends across the Bay Area, who had very similar interests in me. Like Interact, I was also in VSA for all 4 years: Freshman year I was a general member, then became Treasurer in Sophomore to Junior year, and finally became Co- President my Senior year. I have always been culturally connected to my roots, so being a part of this club allowed me to share that with the rest of the student body. Last but not least, I was on my high school badminton team for all four years, and became captain my senior year. I thoroughly enjoy helping the team; It is so rewarding to see underclassmen who have never held a racket before in the beginning of the season slowly transform throughout the season. <br><br>

        As an extrovert,I am confident in my communication skills and am able to connect with the brothers effectively, both socially and professionally. Since I have been a part of multiple organizations and clubs in high school, I fully understand the importance and distinction between work and play, which is essential to maintaining a healthy balance between my social life and club work. I also am able to provide and receive constructive criticism, as I am not afraid to speak up when I do not agree with something and am open to hearing and understanding differing perspectives.
